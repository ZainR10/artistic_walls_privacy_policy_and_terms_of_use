        <h2>Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Use</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 29, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Artistic Walls</strong>. This app is developed and maintained by <strong>Mohammad Zain Rehman</strong>.</p>

        <!-- ===== SECTION 1: PRIVACY POLICY ===== -->
        <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting the personal data I collect.</p>

        <h3>Information I Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Your Name, Email Address, and Profile Image are collected through Google Sign-In (Firebase Authentication) to enable account features and sync your Favorites and subscription status.</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase Data:</strong> When you make an in-app purchase, I receive and store a purchase token, product ID, and subscription expiry date from Google Play. This is used solely to verify and grant your subscription access. I do not store your payment card details — all billing is handled entirely by Google Play.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Firebase UID is used to manage your session and ensure app security.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> I do not collect behavioral analytics or tracking data beyond what Firebase Authentication requires.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>All data is transmitted securely using HTTPS and stored on Cloudflare's infrastructure. Purchase tokens are validated server-side via the Google Play Developer API and never exposed to any third party.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>I use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> — Authentication &amp; session management</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> — In-app purchase processing and subscription management</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — Advertising (only shown to non-subscribed users)</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare Workers &amp; D1</strong> — Backend API and database</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudflare R2</strong> — Wallpaper image storage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to any third parties.</p>

        <h3>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h3>
        <p>I retain your data as long as your account is active. You can request data deletion directly within the app settings or via our <a href="https://zainr10.github.io/artistic_walls_delete_account_web/">Account Deletion page</a>. All deletion requests are processed within 7 days of verification.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Billing &amp; Renewal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All purchases are processed by <strong>Google Play</strong>. Prices are shown in your local currency before purchase.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
            <li>Your Google Play account is charged within 24 hours before the renewal date.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time through the Google Play Store:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <strong>Google Play Store</strong> → tap your profile icon</li>
            <li>Go to <strong>Payments &amp; subscriptions</strong> → <strong>Subscriptions</strong></li>
            <li>Find <strong>Artistic Walls</strong> and tap <strong>Cancel subscription</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Or visit: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions" target="_blank">play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions</a></p>
        <p>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You retain access until then.</p>

        <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>Since all billing is handled by Google Play, refund requests must be submitted directly to Google. I do not independently process refunds. To request a refund:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank">Google Play's refund request page</a></li>
            <li>Or contact Google Play Support directly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>⚠️ Note on Account Deletion &amp; Subscriptions:</strong> Deleting your Artistic Walls account removes your purchase records from our servers but does <strong>not</strong> cancel your active Google Play subscription. You must cancel through Google Play separately to stop future charges.
        </div>

        <h3>Access After Subscription Ends</h3>
        <p>When a subscription expires or is cancelled, premium wallpapers and ad-free features will no longer be accessible. Non-premium wallpapers remain freely available.</p>
